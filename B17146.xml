            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO M<seg rend="sup">R.</seg> CARY's Reply, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Cary</hi> says, That the People of <hi>England</hi> wants Work; and therefore he is for prohibiting <hi>Indian Silks</hi> and <hi>Callicoes:</hi> Which is to raise a Tax on the Subject to maintain them.</p>
            <p>Certainly no man that knows the state of <hi>England</hi> would ever use such an Argument; for, it is but too apparent we want not Work, but People, having Work enough to employ double the number of Hands. Let us but consider how much the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> gain by their Fishing-Trade in our Seas, and what the Value is of the several Goods imported into, and spent in <hi>England,</hi> which might by Diligence (not Prohibitions) be produced and manufactur'd here; those two Articles, tho' others may be added, are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to shew, that we <hi>do not</hi> want Work in <hi>England,</hi> but rather People, and Laws to oblige them to work.</p>
            <p>He is likewise for Confining the Trade of <hi>England</hi> barely to Exchanging of Commodities, therefore would have no <hi>East-India</hi> Goods wore, because they are not the Returns of our Product and Manufactury, but of Mony: Whereas in truth the <hi>East-India</hi> Company hath sent out, since <hi>October</hi> 1693, near Three hundred and Fifty thousand Pounds in English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts. Yet, supposing his Position were true, I affirm, That it is the Interest of <hi>England</hi> to send their Product and Manufactury to the best Market, and from thence to bring such Commodities as they cannot purchase cheaper any where else▪ which they ought to lay out where they may buy cheapest; and by this natural Circulation the Nation will be enrich'd; but, That we shall be oblig'd to take Commodities in exchange for ours, tho' never so dear, is a Doctrin that no Merchant, or any Nation that understands their Interest, will hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to.</p>
            <p>But he adds, <hi>That if we do not take Their Manufacturies, they will not take Ours:</hi> Therefore he is for encouraging <hi>German Linnens,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We send to <hi>Germany,</hi> Leather, Tin, Lead, Copprice, Woolen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a great many other Goods of our Plantations, with which they cannot be supplied any where else cheaper. We do likewise take of them what is fit for our purpose. Now, if we take less of their <hi>Linnens,</hi> the ballance must be paid us in <hi>Mony,</hi> and that Mony ought to be laid out to the best advantage. Now, if <hi>Callicoes</hi> be three times cheaper than <hi>Linnens,</hi> as he allows, the Question is, Whether we had better send one third of that Mony to <hi>India</hi> to buy <hi>Callicoes,</hi> or take it out in <hi>Linnens</hi> from <hi>Germany,</hi> at treble the price.</p>
            <p>As to the Laws in force, which put a Restraint upon Trade, I will not pretend to meddle, leaving it to those who may more properly do it; I humbly conceive they are of the same nature with the Act for prohibiting <hi>Irish Cattel,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> is so much against.</p>
            <p>I think the Example of the <hi>Dutch</hi> ought to be follow'd, since that by their Trade and Policy, of a <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r Distressed</hi> People, they are become the <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Mighty</hi> of the World, in less than a Hundred Years, and that under the great Disadvantage of a very chargable Country. Indeed their Method of Trade is far different from that of Mr. <hi>Cary</hi>'s, they have Lands and Manufacturies in proportion to the bigness of their Country, yet they do not think it the Interest of the Freeholder to curb Trade, knowing that the only way to raise the Price of Lands and other Estates, is by a Free Trade, which encreases Wealth and People.</p>
            <p>A Free Trade makes all manner of Commodities cheap; the cheapness of Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties impowers our People to work cheaper; the cheapness of Work encourages a Foreign Trade; and a Foreign Trade brings Wealth and People, and that alone raises the Price of Lands and Houses.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, Prohibitions make Cloathing and every thing else dear; so that the People cannot live without they have a proportionable price for their Labour. And I conceive Prohibitions to be a principal Reason why we cannot Trade so cheap as our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours do.</p>
            <p>Our Author concludes with his Method of making the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade profitable to the Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> by bringing <hi>Cotton</hi> and other Commodities, which being bulky, will employ more Shipping. That is in effect to say, We shall bring to <hi>England</hi> Materials to be manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factur'd which will stand us in a great deal more than the Goods now do ready manufactur'd. This is the way he proposes to enrich the Nation. I must confess it is of a Piece with the rest of his Discourse upon this Subject; it will employ the Poor to Weave and Spin, and that is what he aims at right or wrong, not having a due Consideration whether the Nation gets by it, or not.</p>
